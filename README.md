# GCFW-Mods
Some mods for GemCraft - Frostborn Wrath.

[Bezel Mod Loader](https://github.com/gemforce-team/BezelModLoader) is required and needs to be at least version 0.3.1 for these mods to work.

A config file will be created in %AppData%\com.giab.games.gcfw.steam\Local Store\CoreModCollection which will allow you to choose which mods are enabled.
