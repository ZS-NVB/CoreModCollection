# CoreModCollection
Some mods for GemCraft - Frostborn Wrath.

[Bezel Mod Loader](https://github.com/gemforce-team/BezelModLoader) is required and needs to be at least version 0.3.1 for these mods to work.

Some of these mods will modify your savefile so backup your saves before using the mods if you don't want to risk accidentally having a mod do that.

To install this, download the swf from [here](https://github.com/ZS-NVB/CoreModCollection/releases) and put it in your mods folder.

Once the game is run with this mod installed, a config file will be created in %AppData%\com.giab.games.gcfw.steam\Local Store\CoreModCollection which will allow you to choose which mods are enabled.

## AchievementDisabler

Prevents you from getting steam achievements (but doesn't prevent you from getting in-game achievements). No idea if it does anything if you're not using the steam version. 

## AllFragmentsHaveRunes

Makes every talisman fragment have a rune.

## BetterBleeding

Makes the True Colors and Bleeding skills increase bleeding damage multiplier instead of duration and adds a third bonus to the Bleeding skill which increases bleeding duration by 20% per 5 levels.

## BetterCritChance

Uncaps crit chance, makes lanterns not have a crit chance cap either, makes traps and amplifiers increase crit chance (it won't show in stats gained through amplification though) and changes how crit chance scales.

## BetterResonance

Makes resonance give 4% damage per level (up from 3%) and replaces its useless range bonus with 4% additional damage for grade 7+ gems per 5 levels.

## BetterSlowing

Makes the True Colors and Slowing skills increase slow component power instead of duration and adds a third bonus to the Slowing skill which increases slow duration by 20% per 5 levels, makes different sources of slow (slow special, snow, orblets and whiteout) stack less effectively, changes how slow ratio scales with slow component power and removes the cap on slow ratio.

## BetterTrueColors

Makes true colors give 4% gem specials per level and 4% gem damage per 5 levels, makes it affect quint and prismatic gems and makes it not affect the gem special count modifiers display.

## BleedingMultiplierDisplay

Displays bleed effect as a multiplier instead of a percentage.

## EnrageAnyWave

Removes the mechanic which makes the next wave be unenraged when adding a gem to the enraging socket after the first wave.

## IceShardsDamageReversion

Puts Ice Shards' base health shred back to 20% like it originally was.

## JourneyGems

Allows you to use gem types you have the skill for when doing a field for the first time in journey.

## JourneyTraits

Allows you to use battle traits when doing a field for the first time in journey.

## LanternMuter

Makes lanterns not make any sounds.

## MapLimitsRemover

Removes the limits on how far you can scroll the map so you can activate mods and unlock mods at any point in the game.

## ModUnlocker

Unlocks all the in-game mods. Works by making the mods not need to be unlocked to toggle them so the effects of this mod can be reverted by disabling it (but any mods activated which haven't been unlocked won't be able to be disabled until the mod is unlocked).

## NoTalismanLocks

Gets rid of the locks in the talisman.

New in version 1.2: Works by making the locks inactive and doesn't actually set the slots to be unlocked so the effects of this mod can be reverted by disabling it (but any fragments in slots which aren't unlocked will stay there).

## ProportionateFragmentDrops

Makes the chance of a dropped talisman fragment being an inner, edge or corner proportional to how many slots the talisman has for that type of fragment (that is, 36% chance for an inner, 48% chance for an edge and 16% chance for a corner). Also gets rid of the level requirements for getting edge and corner fragments from drops.

## RangeAdjustmentFix

Fixes the problems with range adjustment and thus makes beam range not be reduced while a gem's range is above beam's max range.

## Rarity100PlusFragments

Allows for rarity 100 fragments with more properties and maximum upgrade level than usual. The rarity range of battles has been changed so that the minimum rarity is uncapped and the maximum rarity is set to whatever is larger out of what it usually would be and the minimum rarity. Each 10 rarity above 100 gives an additional property and upgrade level.

## RotatableFragments

Allows talisman fragments to be rotated by pressing R while the cursor is over them in the talisman fragment inventory. When adding a talisman fragment to the shape collection, all rotations of it will also be added. When loading a save, all rotations of shapes in the shape collection will also be added to the shape collection, so this mod has irreversible effects on savefiles.

## ShrineFix

Makes the percentage health damage of shrines not be affected by modifiers and just directly multiply health. Also reverts the health shred back to what it originally was.

## TrapTargetFix

Makes traps apply their target priority on every shot, makes the random priority random again, makes traps on highest banishment cost/special/carrying orblet sort the list of targets in the correct order, makes traps no longer have a limit on the number of times a single monster can be hit in one frame and makes traps not fire at dead monsters.
